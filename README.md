## About

### `payjoin`

The Payjoin Dev Kit `payjoin` library implements both [BIP 78 Payjoin V1](https://github.com/shesek/bips/blob/master/bip-0078.mediawiki) and [BIP 77 Payjoin V2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1483).

The `payjoin` crate is compatible with many wallets like LND in [nolooking](https://github.com/chaincase-app/nolooking) and Bitcoin Dev Kit in [Mutiny Wallet](https://github.com/MutinyWallet/mutiny-node) and in [BitMask](https://github.com/diba-io/bitmask-core)

### `payjoin-cli`

The [`payjoin-cli`](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/main/payjoin-cli) crate performs no-frills Payjoin as a reference implementation using Bitcoin Core wallet.

### `payjoin-directory`

The [`payjoin-directory`](https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin/tree/main/payjoin-directory) crate implements the Payjoin Directory store-and-forward server required for Payjoin V2's asynchronous operation.

### Disclaimer ⚠️ WIP

**Use at your own risk. This crate has not yet been reviewed by independent Rust and Bitcoin security professionals.**

While I don't think there is a *huge* risk running it, be careful relying on its security for now!

Seeking review of the code that verifies there is no overpayment. Contributions are welcome!

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The `payjoin` library and `payjoin-cli` should always compile with any combination of features on Rust **1.63.0**.

To build and test with the MSRV you will need to pin the below dependency versions:

### `payjoin`

```shell
cargo update -p cc --precise 1.0.105
cargo update -p regex --precise 1.9.6
cargo update -p reqwest --precise 0.12.4
cargo update -p url --precise 2.5.0
cargo update -p tokio --precise 1.38.1
cargo update -p tokio-util --precise 0.7.11
cargo update -p which --precise 4.4.0
cargo update -p zstd-sys --precise 2.0.8+zstd.1.5.5
```

### `payjoin-cli`

```shell
cargo update -p cc --precise 1.0.105
cargo update -p clap_lex --precise 0.3.0
cargo update -p regex --precise 1.9.6
cargo update -p reqwest --precise 0.12.4
cargo update -p time@0.3.36 --precise 0.3.20
cargo update -p tokio --precise 1.38.1
cargo update -p tokio-util --precise 0.7.11
cargo update -p url --precise 2.5.0
cargo update -p which --precise 4.4.0
cargo update -p zstd-sys --precise 2.0.8+zstd.1.5.5
```

## Contributing

### Upgrading dependencies

If your change requires a dependency to be upgraded you must do the following:

1. Modify `Cargo.toml`
2. Copy `Cargo-minimal.lock` to `Cargo.lock`
3. Trigger cargo to update the required entries in the lock file - use `--precise` using the minimum version number that works
4. Test your change
5. Copy `Cargo.lock` to `Cargo-minimal.lock`
6. Update `Cargo-recent.lock` if it is also behind
7. Commit both lock files together with `Cargo.toml` and your code changes
